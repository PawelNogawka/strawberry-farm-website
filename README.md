Live site: https://pawelnogawka.github.io/strawberry-farm-website/

While creating this website, I learned how to create:
- Animated logo
- Interesting animations of navigation on mobile devices using the opacity, tranform and visibility properties
- Tooltips
- A slider that uses the flex and transform properties
- Search filter, which searches for people, filter is based on the api from randomuser.me
- A simple checkbox that uses some javascript and css
